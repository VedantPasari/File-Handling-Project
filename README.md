# 📝 File Handling Tool — A Simple Python Project

Welcome to my mini Python project! This script is a **command-line file handling tool** that lets you create, read, update, and delete files — all from your terminal. Think of it like a basic Notepad, but with Python and terminal interaction. 😄

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Have you ever needed a quick way to manage files without opening File Explorer or an editor? This script helps you:

🔍 **See all files and folders** in your current directory  
📄 **Create new text files** and write into them  
📖 **Read contents** of existing files  
✏️ **Update files** (rename, overwrite, or append content)  
🗑️ **Delete files** safely  

It’s built using Python's standard libraries (`pathlib` and `os`) — no extra installations needed!

## 💡 How It Works

When you run the script, it gives you a simple menu:

1. Create file
2. Read file
3. Update file
4. Delete file
